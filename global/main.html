            <p> Wiki racing is a game where you navigate from a starting Wikipedia page to the finishing one, racing against friends to do it in the shortest time and fewest clicks. </p>
            <p> You're only allowed to navigate by clicking links to other pages. The search bar is disabled by this extension and changing the URL from the address bar is cheating. </p>
            <p> Do not click on links that take you outside of Wikipedia, although this extension should prevent that. The host can change which language of Wikipedia you're playing on. </p>
            <p> To play, choose one person to host the game, who will receive a game code that others can use to join the game. When you're finished, you'll see the leaderboard, sorted by time. </p>
